# **Rovelli**
**Rovelli** is a free GUI tool for generating an overview of the current year and also a progress bar that visualizes this overview. This application supports the [Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) and [Jalali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar) calendars.
The name of the application is derived from the famous Italian physicist **[Carlo Rovelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli)**, which in his theory, time is an illusion.
